### Welcome

This public repo is for my neovim configuration.

Huge thank you to Radley E. Lewis for the extremely pleasant minimalist config.
It truly showcases just how powerful neovim without any plugins can be.  It certainly leaves some
things to be desired but its a beautiful configuration with minimal dependencies.

Some small additions I made for <leader>w and <leader>q for saving and quiting.  Likely to make
a few more changes here and there as I work with it.  Overall I'm in a better position to actually
answer the question "why would I need addittional plugins."
